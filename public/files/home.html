<h2 id="getting-started-with-unidokkan">Getting Started with UniDokkan</h2>
<div>This guide is for new or returning users of the UniDokkan patching system for Dokkan Battle.</div>
<div><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> As you go through this guide and use UniDokkan you must agree to the following things:
</div>
<ol>
    <li><strong>UniDokkan is currently in beta!</strong> This means that features will change or things can break at any
        time.</li>
    <li><strong>Keep your Dokkan Battle account safe!</strong> The best thing you can do is keep your account linked to
        Facebook. An unlinked account is the best way to lose the account forever. Don&#39;t gamble with account
        recovery denying your account.</li>
    <li><strong>You are the only one responsible for your Dokkan Battle account!</strong> Do not use UniDokkan (or any
        other mod) if you refuse to accept the risk of being banned by breaking Dokkan Battle&#39;s Terms of Service. I
        go through great effort to make sure the patching system remains undetected, but nothing is perfect.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="what-is-unidokkan"><strong>What is UniDokkan?</strong></h2>
<div>UniDokkan is an Android patching system for Dokkan Battle. It allows you to enable and disable modifications to the
    game simply and safely without the need for a rooted device.</div>
<div>We also have a great open community where all kinds of technical information is shared to learn about about Dokkan.
    It&#39;s my personal goal that people in the UniDokkan community can learn new things to be used elsewhere in their
    future. </div>
<div>Finally, there is the UniDokkan website where I personally host Dokkan tools, like a fully in-browser Dokkan
    animation player, and a Wiki where I try and keep all our information for UniDokkan and Dokkan in one place.</div>
<hr>
<h2 id="getting-started"><strong>Getting Started</strong></h2>
<div><strong>First,</strong> you must download the following to your Android device:</div>
<ol>
    <li><strong>UniDokkan Dokkan APK (UD):</strong>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://unidokkan.com/api/sl/apk/glb">Download Global</a></li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>UniDokkan Patcher:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://unidokkan.com/api/sl/patcher">Download Patcher</a></li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ol>
<div>You do not need to uninstall any other Dokkan Battle versions. If you have the space on your device, I recommend that
    you keep any other version you have.</div>
<div><strong>Emulator Warning:</strong>
    <em>Your emulator must be using Android version 5. Please follow your emulator&#39;s instructions. We do not
        officially support emulators but have seen success with <strong>Nox</strong> and <strong>Memu</strong>.</em>
